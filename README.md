# WebDev Classroom - A Collaborative Web Development Platform

WebDev Classroom is an interactive web-based platform designed to support a collaborative web development environment for students and teachers. The platform provides a range of tools and resources that students can access on a local network, using the teacher's computing resources for various activities like coding, sharing notes, chatting in groups, downloading educational resources, and even scraping webpages.

## Features & Capabilities

### **1. IDE for Web Development**
- **Code Editor:** Students can use a web-based IDE to write, save, and load code in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The teacher’s server provides the computational resources for running and compiling the code.
- **Project Management:** Students can create and manage projects, organizing their work in an easy-to-access structure.
- **Save and Load Code:** Users can save their code for later work and load previously saved projects for editing.

### **2. Group Chat**
- **Real-Time Communication:** Students can communicate in real-time via a group chat feature, allowing for discussion and collaboration on assignments and projects.
- **Message History:** Chat history is saved and accessible for users to review past discussions.
- **Personalized Chat:** Each student has their own username, and messages are saved with their corresponding usernames for easy identification.

### **3. File Sharing**
- **Upload and Download Notes:** Students can upload and download files, such as notes, assignments, and other educational resources.
- **File Organization:** Files are organized in a central location for easy access by all students.
- **Web Scraper Files:** The platform includes a feature to scrape HTML content from webpages, which students can download for analysis or use in their projects.

### **4. Web Scraping**
- **Scrape Webpages:** The platform includes a built-in web scraper that allows students to extract HTML content from websites. This can be used for educational purposes, like analyzing webpages or gathering data for projects.
- **Download Scraped Data:** The data collected via scraping can be downloaded and used for further work, such as in research or assignments.

### **5. Resource Access**
- **Download Educational Books:** Students can download books related to web development and other topics directly from the platform, providing them with learning resources at their fingertips.
- **Access to Teacher's Resources:** The teacher can upload resources, including books, notes, and other educational materials, for students to download.

## How It Works

- **Teacher's Role:** The teacher hosts the platform on a local network, providing access to all students. The teacher can manage resources, including notes, books, and project files, and can monitor student activity within the platform.
- **Student's Role:** Students log into the platform using their assigned usernames, where they can access the IDE, participate in group chats, upload and download files, and scrape webpages for educational purposes.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for interactive web pages and the IDE)
- **Backend:** Python (for handling server-side requests and scraping functionalities)
- **Web Scraping:** Selenium for dynamic page scraping, BeautifulSoup for parsing static HTML
- **File Management:** Secure file storage for notes, code, and scraped data

## Getting Started
1. **Set Up Local Server:** The teacher must set up the platform on a local network, ensuring all students can connect.
2. **Log In:** Students log in with their assigned usernames.
3. **Start Using the Platform:** Students can start coding, chatting, and accessing resources.

## Conclusion
WebDev Classroom is a robust, interactive platform designed to enhance the web development learning experience for students by providing them with essential tools for coding, communication, and collaboration. It leverages the teacher’s computing resources and local network to create an efficient and effective learning environment.
